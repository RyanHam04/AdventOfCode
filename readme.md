### Summary Table

| Day   | Stars | Tries Part 1 | Tries Part 2 | Time Complexity       | Evaluation                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----- | ----- | ------------ | ------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Day 1 | ⭐⭐  | 1            | 1            | O(n<sup>2</sup>)      | Regarding time complexity, it could have been improved by using "Counter()" for instant lookup. It uses O(n) time to build the dictionary. Placing this outside of the for-loop would decrease the time complexity to O(n) |
| Day 2 | ⭐⭐  | 1            | 3            | O(m \* n<sup>2</sup>) | The overall time complexity of part 2 is O(m \* n<sup>2</sup>), m being the number of lines and n the amount of items per list. Up until now I have not found significant optimizations                                    |
